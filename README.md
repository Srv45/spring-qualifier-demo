<b>This project demonstrates the use of the @Qualifier annotation in a Spring application. The example involves multiple implementations of a Sim interface (Airtel and Jio) and shows how the @Qualifier annotation helps to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple candidates.<br><br>
Key Features</b><br>
Demonstrates how to use the @Qualifier annotation to resolve ambiguity in bean injection.<br>
Implements multiple beans (Airtel and Jio) of the same interface (Sim).<br>
Simplified structure for learning and practice.<br>
